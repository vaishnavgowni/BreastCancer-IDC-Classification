## Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning - IDC Classification

### Business Understanding:
Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among Women worldwide accounting 25% of all the Cancer cases. Early diagnosis
significantly increases the chances of survival as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. On the other hand, accurate
classification of benign tumors (non-cancerous) can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Breast cancer is a
type of cancer that begins in the breast. Cancer begins when cells start to develop out of control. Breast cancer cells usually
form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. It is critical to comprehend that most breast lumps are benign
and not malignant. Here, benign infers non-cancerous tumor and malignant suggests cancer. Non-cancerous breast tumors are
strange developments, yet they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not dangerous; however, a few kinds of benign
breast lumps can build a woman's danger of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change should be checked by a health
care professional to decide whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) and on the off chance that it may influence your future
cancer hazard. 

**Goal:** To detect the cancer:

Here, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) indicates presence of cancer. 

**Dataset:** The dataset (the breast cancer histology image dataset) from Biomedcentral and Kaggle. This dataset holds 2,77,524 patches of size 50Ã—50 extracted from 162 whole mount slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at 40x. Of these, 1,98,738 test negative and 78,786 test positive with IDC.

Filenames in this dataset looks like the below:

8913_idx5_x751_y1701_class1

Here, 8913_idx5 is the patient ID, 751 and 1701 are the x- and y- coordinates of the crop, and 1 is the class label (1 denotes presence of IDC).
